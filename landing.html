                <h3><a href="javascript:void(0)">All Parents on One Platform</a></h3>
                <p>
                    We have pioneered an approach in line with GDPR that ensures all parents are encouraged to get involved and engage with your school.
                    Our support team is on hand to guide parents through the simple set-up process.
                    Access to parents through a single platform is vital for improving efficiency in schools.

                <h3><a href="javascript:void(0)">Provide Meaningful Information</a></h3>
                <p>
                    Our innovations are always backed by research. Our research told us that for parents to take up an active role in their child’s education, they want information that is regular, meaningful and specific to their child’s attainment.
                    And so, we have teamed up with SIMS to provide parents just what they need.

                <p>
                    To empower parents, it is important to empower teachers first. It is for this reason that we provide teachers with the ability to communicate directly with a parent in an instant.
                    To truly boost attainment and well-being of students, teachers must be empowered with the relevant skills in school to home communication.

                <p>
                    As every student is unique, so is each school.
                    Rather than bombarding you with generic statistics on our success at other schools,
                    we will support you with surveys and analytics to chart success and understand the true impact of InvolvEd on parental confidence at your school.
